    <h1> ü•ê Croissant</h1>
    <p>A croissant is a flaky, buttery pastry in a crescent shape, typically enjoyed for 
        breakfast or as a snack. It's made from a laminated yeast dough, similar to puff pastry, 
        and can be plain or filled with various ingredients. Croissants are often enjoyed 
        with coffee or tea.
